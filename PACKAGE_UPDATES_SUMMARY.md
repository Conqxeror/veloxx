# Package Description Updates Summary

## Updated Configurations for Publishing

### 1. Cargo.toml (crates.io)
**Updated Description:**
```
Veloxx: High-performance, lightweight Rust library for in-memory data processing and analytics. Features DataFrames, Series, advanced I/O (CSV, JSON, Parquet), machine learning (linear regression, K-means, logistic regression), time-series analysis, data visualization, parallel processing, and multi-platform bindings (Python, WebAssembly). Designed for minimal dependencies, optimal memory usage, and blazing speed - ideal for data science, analytics, and performance-critical applications.
```

**Updated Keywords:**
```
["dataframe", "analytics", "data-processing", "machine-learning", "time-series", "statistics", "csv", "json", "parquet", "visualization", "python-bindings", "wasm", "parallel", "simd", "performance"]
```

### 2. pyproject.toml (PyPI)
**Updated Description:**
```
Veloxx: High-performance, lightweight Python library for in-memory data processing and analytics. Built on Rust for blazing speed and memory efficiency. Features DataFrames, Series, advanced I/O (CSV, JSON, Parquet), machine learning (linear regression, K-means, logistic regression), time-series analysis, data visualization, and parallel processing. Perfect for data science, analytics, and performance-critical applications where speed and memory usage matter.
```

**Updated Keywords:**
```
["dataframe", "analytics", "data-processing", "machine-learning", "time-series", "statistics", "csv", "json", "parquet", "visualization", "rust", "performance", "parallel", "data-science", "pandas-alternative"]

## Key Improvements

1. **Detailed Descriptions**: Replaced generic descriptions with comprehensive feature lists
2. **Optimized Keywords**: Added platform-specific and feature-specific keywords for better discoverability
3. **Enhanced Categorization**: Added relevant PyPI classifiers for better categorization
4. **Platform-Specific Optimization**: Tailored descriptions for each platform's audience
5. **Complete npm Configuration**: Created proper npm package.json for WASM bindings publishing

## Publishing Commands

### Rust Crate (crates.io)
```bash
cargo publish
```

### Python Package (PyPI)
```bash
maturin publish
```

### npm Package (npmjs)
```bash
# Build WASM package first
